Simple CRM made to keep Java/Spring boot skills sharp.

Some features:

- DB is H2 file database(in future will be docker container with Postgresql)
- Flyway migrations used
- JDBC API used, to refresh raw SQL knowledge as well
- Some tests are written, but not full coverage for now
- Will be in docker containers
